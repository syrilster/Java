## Lambdas

Idea of replacing clutter in the code. i.e. lambda essentially will have only the parameter list and the body.For example remove unnecessary code from a anonymous inner class.

```
Thread th = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
   System.out.println("In another thread");
  }  
});
th.start();
```
Lambda code:

```
Thread th = new Thread(() ->  System.out.println("In another thread"));
th.start();

```

## Lambdas under the hood
* Note that the compiler here is not actually replacing the lambda with the anonymous inner class code.
* How did java solve this issue of bloated inner class generated by the compiler? -  **invokedynamic**
* invokedynamic - Attach and detach a function dynamically at runtime for dynamically typed lanuages like Jruby or groovy
* In java 8 invokedynamic was rewritten to support lambda expressions + dynamically typed languages.
